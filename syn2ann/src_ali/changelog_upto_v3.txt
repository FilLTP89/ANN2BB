Change log

MAIN.m
- Loop is added to create n number of synthetics
(it was 500, now I changed it to 10 as prof. Paolucci wrote)
- score.m and get_the_best.m are created to get the closest syn.
- output visualization part is modified by Maria (See the last step)
- target spectrum is calculated here (though it may be taken out of loop)

LF_HF_Hybridization.m
- Lines 74-78: 
f_low and f_high are seperated a little from each other
f_high_up is significantly modified
Comment: f_high may be further translated (but how much?)
 
ANN_Combination.m
- Lines 29-34: Different tolerances 
(used if variability is activated & control of convergence)
- niter_h and niter_v: two different numbers 
(niter_h should be kept small after today's discussion, around 10)
(niter_v? boh? Maybe around 20-30?)
The bottom line is to be between 20% error band and use as low as
possible
- A control condition is added. n<27 (out of 29 points) gives 3
points to remain outside the specified limits. Strict condition.
- hybrid motion related parts (acc, vel, dis, RSA) are changed to 
the best hybrid rather than the last hybrid.

SpectralMatching.m
- Short/Long period of response spectrum is treated differently (lines 30-31)
- One extra period point is added (See line 49-54): Enhances the short
period match
- Correction is being made between 0.03-49 Hz (controlled by Nyq. crit)
- Initial acausal oscillations removed (line 180-197)
- Signal is tapered by using a Tukey window
- PGA correction made double-sided (reduces velocity problems)
lines(210-260)
- finally residual velocity is calculated and negative of this value is
added to very initial 4 points around Ia=0.1% 
C:This sounds not good, I know. Almost always, the corrected velocity is very small.
This small velocity disagreement is caused when solving the initial osc. problems
If not corrected, ends up with not reasonable displacement evolution.
In most of the cases, the change is not recognisable.

Postprocessing part (PART 5)
- All arranged by Maria according to Prof. Paolucci's reccomendations
